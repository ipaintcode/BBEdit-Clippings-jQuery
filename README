BBEdit Clippings for jQuery
===========================

Version 0.1 | For use with jQuery (supports 1.7) library http://jquery.com/
===========================================================================

* Inspired by the TextMate bundle maintained by Karl Swedberg: https://github.com/kswedberg/jquery-tmbundle
* Not all "jQuery and $" clippings have been created, but will be added asap (currently there are 167 clippings).
* Heads up, these clippings are W.I.P. so please report any issues you find and I will update ASAP.

Installation
------------

Copy the jQuery.js folder in to your
~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Clippings
folder and restart BBEdit.

Please send all request for bugs fixes or recommendations to:
